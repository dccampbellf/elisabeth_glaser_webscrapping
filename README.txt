WHAT THIS PROJECT IS ABOUT

In this jupyter notebook, I accessed the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric Foundation's webpage and extracted their project information, per country. 

I used Beautiful Soup for retrieval, selenium to click on country profile (pdfs hosted online) and to take a screenshot of the main page. 

I also used REGEX to better locate text sections in the webpages.
